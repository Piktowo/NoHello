## About The Project

Using the **release** build is recommended over the debug build. Only use debug builds if you are going to make a bug report.

## Usage

### KernelSU & APatch users:
1. Install ZygiskNext.
2. Make sure the unmount setting is enabled for the target app in the KernelSU/APatch Manager.
3. Disable `Enforce DenyList` in ZygiskNext settings if there is one.

### Magisk users:
1. Update your Magisk to 28.0 or newer for better hiding capabilities. (optional)
2. Turn on Zygisk in Magisk settings.
3. Turn off `Enforce DenyList` in Magisk settings.
4. Add the target app to the deny list unless you're using a Magisk fork with a white list instead.

## Whitelisting
You can set the working mode to **whitelist** (instead of the default **blacklist**) by creating an empty regular file `/data/adb/nohello/whitelist`.
>[!WARNING]
> Using **Mount Rule System** with **whitelist**, can cause severe overheating & performance issues, due to how MRS being evaluated each time a process spawns.

This can be solved if you make NoHello evaluates Mount Rule System per boot/companion instance, by creating an empty regular file `/data/adb/nohello/umount_persist`/`data/adb/nohello/umount_persists`

## Mount Rule System

**Since version 0.0.5**, NoHello introduces **Mount Rule System**.</br>
This allows users to define **rules** that control how mount points are evaluated for **auto-unmounting**.</br>
Rules are fully configurable and match based on mount point properties like root path, mount path, filesystem type, or source.</br>
**MountRules** can be customized via `/data/adb/nohello/umount`.

### Rule Format

A rule is made up of **sections**, each consisting of a **keyword**, followed by a list of values enclosed in `{}`:

```
<keyword> { <value1> <value2> ... }
```

Valid **keywords** are:

| Keyword  | Matches against         | Supports Wildcards | Description |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `root`   | Root path of the mount  | Yes (`*`, escape by `\*`)     | Root of the mount in `/proc/self/mountinfo` |
| `point`  | Mount point path        | Yes                 | Where the filesystem is mounted |
| `fs`     | Filesystem type         | No                  | Matches exact filesystem type, e.g. `ext4`, `erofs`, etc |
| `source` | Source device or file   | Yes (`*`, no escape)           | e.g., `/dev/block/xyz`, `magisk`, etc |

### Example Rules

#### Match all `tmpfs` filesystems mounted under `/data/adb`:
```
fs { "tmpfs" } point { "/data/adb/*" }
```

#### Match anything mounted from a `tmpfs` source:
```
source { "tmpfs" }
```

#### Match a specific mount path exactly:
```
point { "/mnt/specific/path" }
```

#### Match any source ending with `data`:
```
source { "*data" }
```

#### Match root path starting with `/acct` and fs type `cgroup`:
```
root { "/acct*" } fs { "cgroup" }
```

### Quoting Values

You can quote values with **single or double quotes**:

```
point { "/mnt/with space" '/custom\ path' }
```

You may escape characters like `*`, `{`, `}`, and `"` using backslashes (`\`) if needed.

### Wildcard Behavior

Wildcards are supported only in `root`, `point`, and `source`. The supported patterns are:

- `*value*`: matches substring anywhere (except `root`, `point`)
- `*value`: matches suffix
- `value*`: matches prefix
- Exact match without `*`


>[!NOTE]
> - You can define **multiple rules**, each as a separate line.
> - All rules are evaluated independently.
> - Matching is case-sensitive and optimized for performance.
